# Project Overview
“And I don't care if you're sick <br>
I don't care if you're contagious <br>
I would kiss you even if you were dead <br>
Would somebody make me go blind for the rest of my life? <br>
'Cause I'd do anything to hold your hand” <br>
<b><i> I Don’t Care If You’re Contagious by Pierce The Veil </i></b>

Pierce the Veil wrote this song for a fan whose boyfriend had recently passed away in a car accident. The fan shared that the first time they ever held hands was at a PTV concert, so the band created this song as a gift and sort of a tribute to her. The song is told from the boyfriend’s perspective in the afterlife, where he's expressing how much he loves her and his reluctance to leave because he wants to be with her. Although this piece was written for one person, the meaning of the lyrics allows many others to understand the gravity of this song and also relate from their own personal experiences or just empathize with the girl it was written for, despite not knowing anything about the actual relationship or people involved, strengthening the community around its meaning. Personally, I share this connection with a friend who introduced me to this song, and we’re even going to a PTV concert this year! Every time we hear this song, we think of each other and the fan it was dedicated to, knowing she now has an entire community, an entire fanbase, and even the band supporting and comforting her. Beyond its original purpose, the song provides comfort, closure, and a reminder to cherish those around us. It deepens my appreciation for my friends, family, fanbases I'm a part of, and loved ones who have passed.
